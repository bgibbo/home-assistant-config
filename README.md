# HA Config

Here are the configuration files for my [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) setup.

I'm running HA on a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CDVSBPO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) with a [UZB](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QJEY6OC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) stick for interacting with Z-Wave components and a [Wink Hub 2](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KW8WGZQ/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for the Zigbee bulbs.

For ZWave, I have two [GE 12724 Dimmers](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B006LQFHN2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for my dining room and kitchen lights, which are generally controlled by two [Ecolink Motion Detectors](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQXXG0I/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  I also have a [GE 12720 Outdoor Module](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013V8K3O/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to control my deck lights.

For Zigbee, I have two [Cree Connected](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01701DKVM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) lights for my lamps in the living room and bedroom, and two [Cree Connected Daylight](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01701DL7A/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) bulbs for outside lights.

I also have a [MyQ Garage Controller](https://smile.amazon.com/Chamberlain-MYQ-G0201-MyQ-Garage-Controls-Smartphone/dp/B00EAD65UW/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1493026683&sr=1-1&keywords=myq), but really only use it to keep track of whether my door is open and occasionally to open it remotely when coming home through the alley, and a [Nest Thermostat](https://smile.amazon.com/Nest-Learning-Thermostat-Generation-Amazon/dp/B0131RG6VK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1493027233&sr=8-2&keywords=nest), which came with the house.

I recently grabbed a few amazon dash buttons for $1 apiece, but I haven't actually done anything with them yet.  And I have a z-wave capable lock, which I also haven't really done anything with yet.

## Automation Goals

I don't ever want to touch a light switch again.

## Documentation

If I do anything weird or interesting, I'll try to document it in the [Notes directory](./notes/)
