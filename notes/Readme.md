[Tracking Approximate Darkness](./Darkness.md)

Explains a sensor that takes a couple other sensors (sun angle, dark sky cloudiness, dark sky precipitation intensity) and generates a “darkness percentage”.  A cloudy afternoon would be about a 30%.  Midnight, Overcast, and Raining is 100%.  Sunny Day, Clear Sky is 0.
